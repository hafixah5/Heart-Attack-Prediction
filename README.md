##  :scroll:  Project Description

This project aims to create a machine learning model to predict if a patient have a higher or lower risk of contracting a heart attack.
For this objective, a few variables were taken from patients.
The data collected can be retrieved in the heart.csv file in the repo.

This model achieved a 80% accuracy in determining the risk of developing a heart attack. \n
Logistic Regression with a MinMax Scaler was found to give the highest accuracy compared to Decision Tree, Random Forest, SVC and Gradient Boost.
